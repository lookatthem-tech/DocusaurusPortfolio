Guest Mode is designed to let users without a Prysm user license access content in Prysm. In order to do this in a CHC environment, guest users, potentially from outside the customer organization, will need access to the same network domain where the CHC server resides. In many customer networks, this is an issue because there is a separate network on a separate domain dedicated to guest users.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Hardware/Server Installation Guide/011UninstallingCHCServer":{"id":"Hardware/Server Installation Guide/011UninstallingCHCServer","title":"Uninstalling a CHC server","description":"You can uninstall Prysm from a Customer Hosted Prysm Application Server (VM).
